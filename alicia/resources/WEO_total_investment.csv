Historical data are in CY, but projections are converted by averaging two FYs (i.e. Avg[FY(t-1/t),FY(t/t+1)]= CY(t)). For example, the projection of 2022 is the average of 2021/22 and 2022/23. National accounts manual used: System of National Accounts (SNA) 2008 GDP valuation: Market prices Reporting in calendar year: Yes. Historical calendar year data are calculated by adding up quarterly data from Haver. For example, the calendar year 2018 GDP is the sum of 2018Q1, 2018Q2,2018Q3 and 2018Q4 GDP data. The GDP components(consumption, investment, exports and imports) are distributed proportionally based on the average share of two fiscal year GDP data. For example, CY2018 gross capital formation= CY2018 GDP *average(FY2017/18+FY 2018/19 gross capital formation)/average(FY2017/18+FY 2018/19 GDP). Start/end months of reporting year: January/December. Prior to 2009, the data are in fiscal year (FY) reporting basis converted to calendar year (CY) by averaging two FYs (e.g. CY2008 is the average of FY2007/08 and FY2008/09). Historical quarterly data are taken from Haver to have a smooth series. Base year: 2016. National Accounts were rebased on a FY basis and this rebasing was then applied to CY historical data. As a result real GDP and nominal GDP are not equal in CY 2016.
